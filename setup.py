"""TRNpy: Parallelized TRNSYS simulation with Python.

TRNpy: Parallelized TRNSYS simulation with Python
=================================================
Simulate TRNSYS deck files in serial or parallel and use parametric tables to
perform simulations for different sets of parameters. TRNpy helps to automate
these and similar operations by providing functions to manipulate deck files
and run TRNSYS simulations from a programmatic level.

Module Setup
------------

Run with the following command prompt to install into Python environment:

.. code::

    python setup.py install


"""
from setuptools import setup
from setuptools_scm import get_version


try:
    version = get_version(version_scheme="post-release")
except LookupError:
    version = "0.0.0"
    print(
        "Warning: setuptools-scm requires an intact git repository to detect"
        " the version number for this build."
    )
